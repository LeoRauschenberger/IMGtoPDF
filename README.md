This script (V3) converts all image formats (PNG, JPG and JPEG) to PDF in the folder it is started from. 
It does NOT delete any files.

Please make sure you have PIL, pathlib installed.

Just add the script to any folder, start it and it will find all the files in that folder, compress them and create a PDF.
